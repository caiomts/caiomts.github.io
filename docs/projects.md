## Jobs

Jobs is a small NLP ML model that exposes a API built with [FastAPI](https://github.com/caiomts/jobs_case). The goal of this prototype was to build an end-to-end ML model with an API to request predictions.
The project is packaged into a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container and has focus in
reproducibility, so I used shell scripts, GNU make and GitHub Actions to create a full reproducible project starting with a simple ```$ make```.
