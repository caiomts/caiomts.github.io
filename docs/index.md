# Hey there! I'm Caio :wave:


I started out as a calculations analyst at one of the biggest pension funds in Latin America, where I used stats and finance to model data and make smart choices ðŸ¤“. Then, I got promoted to lead a team of 12 people, which only made me realize even more how important it is to be able to communicate and manage a group. Plus, my attention to detail and problem-solving skills are on point.

During my MBA and Masters in Finance and IT, I just got better at crunching numbers. As a data scientist, I started combining my old-school stats skills with modern machine learning approaches. In addition, I've got some serious Python engineering chops now, so I can build all sorts of cool data things like web applications, dashboards and web APIs.

Nowadays, I'm working as a data/Python engineer and building specialized solutions for health and chemical risk assessment. My main goal is to
make sure the data we're dealing with is top-notch and valuable, so we can make some real progress in these areas.  â€“ that's me - professionally-wise - in a nutshell! ðŸ™‚

Btw (Just to be totally clear, okay? ðŸ˜†), I am totally into data science and software engineering. As a pythonista and someone who's all about FOSS, I'm super grateful for all the awesome projects and tools out there that make our lives way more fun. Like, seriously, thank you to all the developers and creators who make this stuff available for us to use and play with! ðŸ™Œ
