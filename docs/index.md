# Hi there! I'm Caio :wave:

My bread and butter is Python and software engineering, as I've been working as Python engineer (I'd rather Pythonista :laughing:) for some time now. I have 8 years of professional experience, half of them dedicated to crunch data challenges.

I love to study the language and software engineering as a whole. As a Pythonista and a FOSS enthusiast, I'm grateful to all well-documented projects and CI/CD Tools[^1] that make our lives much more fun.

You can find out here :point_down::

## But Why I love Python?

[One of the most popular programming language worldwide].
It's flexible. The english-ish syntax makes it concise, easy to read and code and welcome 
to newcomers. 

[Python is by far the most used language by data scientists] and has a huge supportive community 
and endless open source environment which makes it the best choice for any STEM professional with little or 
no software engineering experience.

Thanks to python flexibility it's also suitable for buiding integrated solutions. Companies usually have gaps between different systems and these gaps are constantly paved by manual and boring work :man_facepalming:. 
But Python is perfect for paving them. It works like a glue. You can grant Python access to different databases, make API requests, create RPA solutions and integrate ML on top of that :exploding_head:!

In brief, Python is versitile and beginner-friendly. It's easy and fast for an iterative development process, but thanks to its robustness and stability, you can use it from prototyping to production.
