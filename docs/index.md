*Pythonista*, Data Scientist, Data Consultant...
Thus, I've been using Python to solve data related problems. I'm a FOSS enthusiastic and I love well-documented projects, Tests,
Automations and CI/CD Tools[^1]. Everything that makes things reliable, reproducible and maitainable... 
you might have read this before.

I like to build integrated data solutions, using different data sources and ML. I'm more into tabular or text data problems 
as I do believe they are somehow more unique and require tailored solutions with a lot of data wrangling, feature engineering and joining forces with subject matter experts. Don't get me wrong, image processing, audio and video are also cool.

Might be important... :man_shrugging_tone1: I hold an MBA in Finance, a Master degree in Finance and Information Technology and I'm an IBM Certified Machine Learning Professional.

## Why Python?

[One of the most popular programming language worldwide].
It's flexible, the english-ish syntax makes it concise, easy to read and code and, welcoming 
to first-time coders. As a general purpose language, Python is known as the second best choice
for solving all kind of programming related problem.

[Python is by far the most used language by data scientists] and has a huge supportive community 
and endless open source environment which makes it the best choice for any STEM professional with little or 
no software engineering experience (myself half-included).

Thanks to python flexibility it's suitable for buiding integrated solutions. Companies have holes between different
systems and these holes are usually paved by manual and boring work :man_facepalming:. But Python is
perfect for paving them. It works like a glue. You can grant Python access to different databases, make API requests, create RPA solutions and integrate ML on top of that :exploding_head:!

In brief, Python is versitile and beginner-friendly. It's easy and fast for an iterative
development process, but thanks to its robustness and stability, you can use it from prototyping to production. 
Python is used by most companies you probably know and is/was part of big projects like [YouTube], [Instagram] and [Dropbox]. 
So the next time someone says Python is slow ask them if they're planning to build something bigger than these projects :wink:.
